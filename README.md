# mern_milestone_project_2
Milestone Project 2 for NCSU Software Development

A project created by Hannah Mills, Benjamin Chandler, and  Danna Bohnhoff.

This project will allow users to utilize the FBI MOST WANTED API to look up cyber criminals, white-collar criminals, and criminals with rewards for capture.

As a group, we will build a complex full-stack application using the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, and Node).
